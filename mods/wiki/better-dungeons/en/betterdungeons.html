					Better Dungeons is a mod that allows you to open a world with a lot of challenges and rewards. <br /> However, do not think that everything is so simple.<br /> Each dungeon is guarded by a lot of monsters, which are not so easy to cope with, but if you still manage - you will get a lot of rewards. <br />Monsters roam the world even during the day, and the sky in this world seems dark green, but night vision reveals its true color - bright green.<br />
